# Cracking the Market Code with AI: Stock Price Prediction

This project uses an LSTM neural network to predict stock prices using historical data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- LSTM-based model for time series prediction
- Prediction script to forecast next-day stock prices

## How to Use
1. Place historical stock data in `data/stock_data.csv`
2. Train the model:# Gowthami-E-Naan-Mudhalvan-Project
